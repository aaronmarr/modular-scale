      <p class="text-base max-w-lg mb-4">This site is 100% inspired by the original Modular Scale tool by Tim Brown. Full credit goes to Tim for the original idea, which was first published in 2011. I built this website as a tool for myself, and as an excuse for trying out some design ideas and technologies I'm interested in.</p>
